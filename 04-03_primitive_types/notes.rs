// a four-bit signed number is any from -8 to +7, whereas an unsigned
// ranges from 0 to +15. Signed types begin with an i, such as:
//   i8, i16, i32, i64, isize
// while unsigned begin with u:
//   u8, u16, u32, u64, usize
// fixed-size types end with a number specifying the number of bits
// they represent. whether signed or unsigned. They include:
//   8, 16, 32, 64
// variable-size types determine representation by the size of a
// pointer. They also have a signed and unsigned variety:

// Slices
// a `slice` creates a reference to another data structure. It 
// provides an efficient and safe way to use some portion of an
